This library consists of several modules that can be extremely useful for you when developing VScripts for Portal 2.

## 1. [Mapspawn](Mapspawn.nut)

`Mapspawn`, contains a bunch of script functions which can do various things. Most functions are meant to be used mid-game

### [`AutoExec`](autoexec.cfg)

# SCNS VScripts Library Documentation

This Vscripts library has many script functions and scripts that can do various things.

# 1. Main Script Functions

## 1a. [Mapspawn](Mapspawn.nut)

`Mapspawn`, contains a bunch of script functions which can do various things. Most functions are meant to be used mid-game

| Function | Description | Example Usage | Extra Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MPTP(PlayerIndex,PlayerIndex)` | Teleports a player to a player origin. | MPTP(2,1) | arg1 is the origin arg2 is moved to |
| `PlacePortal(Portal Pair #, Portal #, Position, Angle)` | Works like portal_place, places a portal anywhere. | PlacePortal(1,1,host.GetOrigin() | Portal Pair # 1=atlas pair and 2 = p-body pair |
| `SetPlayerModel(PlayerIndex,ModelName)` | Sets the model of a player. | SetPlayerModel(1,"models/error.mdl") |  |
| `GetPicker()` | Returns the instance that you're looking at. | local picker = GetPicker() | **Model MUST be precached or else the game will crash!** |
| `FindObject(Object Instance)` | Displays a hint at the object specified. | FindObject(FindByEntIndex(32)) | Hint does not have text. |
| `SetLobbyMovie(filepath)` | Plays a movie of your choice in the main lobby. | SetLobbyMovie("media/attract01.bik") | Can only be executed once. |

| `SetPlayerTeam(PlayerIndex,Team)` | Sets the team of a player based off of their player index. | SetPlayerTeam(1,2) | Team 0 = SinglePlayer, Team 2 = Orange and team 3 = Blue |
| `KillPlayer(PlayerIndex)` | Kills a player. | KillPlayer(1) | Functions almost exactly like the `Kill` console command, except it uses player index instead of the steam names. |
| `SwapPlayerThing()` | Swaps the positions and angles of player 1 and 2 of the coop session. |  | Does not swap portals or swap velocity and can break some chambers if done at the wrong time and place. |

# SCNS

SCNS is a "Script Library" with a bunch of scripts for you to use.

Please note that if you already have ppmod or pcapture-lib installed, then you might want to delete the files for them here so they don't contradict.
The libraries that are used are only ppmod are pcapture-lib, if you have another library then don't delete it.

Some scripts are known to have issues, if you find out the issue and know how to fix it, please open a pull request so it can be fixed.

If you need to see the documentation on scripts, then visit the documentaiton [here](ScriptDocumentation.md).

## Notable Scripts

* **[MapSpawn](mapspawn.nut)**
* Utilizes Developer Convar to make changes
* Ability to change the game in various ways
* Many cool modifications like extra parts of a map and a WIP advanced version of course 01

* **[Improved Noclip Script](test01.nut)**
* Most other noclip scripts that you find(if you can even find one break when you die or just will not work at all if you try to change your team, causing you to manually noclip every time you want to fly.
* Thanks to this improved Noclip Script, all of those issues are fixed! And not only that, there is also an option to change the player that the noclipstate is given to, increasing the capability of this script.
